Its purpose is to clarify the source code and make it easier for people to follow along with what is happening. Anything in a comment is generally ignored when the code is actually run, making comments useful for including explanations and reasoning as well as removing specific lines of code that you may be unsure about. Comments in Python are created by using the pound symbol (`# Insert Text Here`). Including a `#` in a line of code will comment out anything that follows it."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pFzE82VKsFhw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1616363167962,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":377,"user":{"displayName":"Julian Esteban Santos Martinez","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghk_x22NNX-ZFaSpPPwhAmzE39CMU3pI4vwWX7C=s64","userId":"18369316414686541133"}}},"source":["# This is a comment\n","# These lines of code will not change any values\n","# Anything following the first # is not run as code"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eUibQlzQsFhx"},"source":["You may hear text enclosed in triple quotes (`\"\"\" Insert Text Here \"\"\"`) referred to as multi-line comments, but this is not entirely accurate.
